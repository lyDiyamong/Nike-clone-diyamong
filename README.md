This project aims to clone the Nike website to practice and demonstrate front-end development skills. The project includes a responsive design, navigation, and several interactive elements, mimicking the look and feel of the official Nike website.

In this project I've cloned 4 pages with 1 sub-pages.

- Responsive design
- Navigation bar with dropdown menus
- Interactive product display
- Modular and reusable components

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS & Tailwind CSS Framework
- JavaScript (for interactivity and component) 

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://git.clp.kr/anbschool/2nd/tech-a/ly-diyamong/lydiyamong-nike-clone.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd lydiyamong-nike-clone
3. **Link for Tailwind CSS framework installation this Project**:
    - Prerequisites:
      + Git installed: Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can check by running git --version in your terminal. If not installed, download it from 
          https://git-scm.com/downloads.
      + Node.js and npm installed: Node.js is required for npm, the package manager used in this project. Download and install the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version from        https://nodejs.org/en.

    - Steps:
      + Clone the Repository:
        - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
        - Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the remote repository you cloned from (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):
      + Install Dependencies:
        - Navigate to the cloned project directory
        - Since node_modules is likely excluded in the .gitignore file, you'll need to reinstall the project's dependencies using npm:
          npm install
        - This command downloads and installs all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file, including Tailwind CSS and any other project dependencies.

      + Run/Build the project
        - If your project uses a build process to optimize and compile assets (usually for production environments), check the package.json file for a script named build or similar. If present, run: 
          npm run build
      + View the Website:
        - Open the index.html file in your text editor or code editor.
        - Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with" or "Open in Browser" (depending on your operating system).
